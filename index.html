        <h1>How Credit Card Debt Actually Works Over Time</h1>
        <p class="hero-lead">
          Credit card debt is not just “what you owe today”. It is a moving balance affected by purchases,
          interest, fees and how consistently you repay. This page explains the mechanics in neutral, simple terms.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is Credit Card Debt?</h2>
      <p>
        When you use a credit card and do not repay the full statement balance by the due date, the unpaid amount
        becomes <strong>revolving debt</strong>. This balance stays on the account and is carried into the next
        billing cycle, where interest and any new transactions are added.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike a fixed loan with a clear end date, credit card debt is open-ended. You choose how much to repay
        (above the minimum), and the remaining balance continues forward. This flexibility is useful, but it also
        makes it easy to underestimate how long repayment will take and how much interest will be paid.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Growth of debt -->
    <section id="growth" class="section">
      <h2>How Balances Grow: Purchases, Interest & Fees</h2>
      <p>Credit card debt can increase even if you are paying something every month. Common drivers include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>New purchases on top of old balances:</strong>
          if spending continues while past balances are still unpaid, the total can rise faster than repayments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Interest on the revolving balance:</strong>
          once you lose the interest-free period, interest is charged on what remains from month to month.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fees:</strong>
          late-payment fees, over-limit fees or cash-advance fees add to the total balance and themselves accrue interest.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Compounding over time:</strong>
          interest is calculated repeatedly, so carrying a balance for many months can become significantly more expensive.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Understanding these mechanics is essential before comparing “rewards”, because the cost of carrying debt
        can easily outweigh the value of points or cashback.
      </p>

    <!-- Repayment patterns -->
    <section id="repayment" class="section">
      <h2>Minimum Payments & Repayment Behaviour</h2>
      <p>
        Card statements usually show a <strong>minimum payment</strong> – the smallest amount required to keep the
        account in good standing. Paying only the minimum often means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Most of the payment goes to interest rather than reducing the balance.</li>
        <li>The repayment horizon stretches over many years, even for modest amounts.</li>
        <li>Total interest paid can exceed the original purchases over time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Increasing payments even slightly above the minimum can dramatically shorten the time to clear the balance
        and reduce the total cost. Educational repayment calculators (often provided by regulators or banks) can
        illustrate how different payment levels change the projection.
      </p>
      <p class="small">
        Debts.Creditcard does not provide personal financial advice or recommend specific repayment strategies.
        It focuses on explaining structures so you can better understand information from official sources and
        qualified advisers.

    <!-- Warning signs & habits -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Common Warning Signs & Helpful Habits</h2>
      <p>Some patterns often indicate that credit card debt is becoming harder to manage:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Relying on credit cards for regular essentials every month.</li>
        <li>Using one card to make payments on another, directly or indirectly.</li>
        <li>Only paying the minimum for many months in a row.</li>
        <li>Frequently approaching or exceeding the credit limit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Helpful habits discussed in many educational resources include separating long-term debt from daily spending,
        tracking utilisation (balance versus limit) and checking statements carefully for fees and interest charges.
